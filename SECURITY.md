## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep your browser updated** to the latest version
2. **Use HTTPS** when accessing the application
3. **Don't share sensitive information** in search queries
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

### For Developers

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
3. **Validate all user inputs** before processing
4. **Implement proper CORS** policies
5. **Use HTTPS** for all API calls

## Known Security Considerations

### API Key Exposure

The current implementation includes API keys in the client-side code. This is **not recommended for production use**.

**Recommendations:**
- Use a backend proxy for API calls
- Implement proper authentication
- Use environment variables
- Consider rate limiting

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent:
- XSS attacks
- Injection attacks
- Malicious script execution

### CORS Policy

The application implements proper CORS policies to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 2.0.1, 2.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the changelog.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- **No public disclosure** until the issue is fixed
- **Credit given** to security researchers
- **Timely updates** to affected users
